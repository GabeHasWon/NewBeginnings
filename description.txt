- New Beginnings -

This mod adds in player origins (or backgrounds), which allow you to start a new player off with different max life, mana, items, or even world changes like a different spawn.
These are all accessible by default through the character creation screen; a little button next to the player name switches the menu to player origin mode.
From then on, choose whichever background you like and enjoy!

There are also a couple of unlockable origins - play more to discover how to unlock these.
