- Fixed locked origins being usable through the Random origin
- Slayer is now a 3 star origin now that the Ash forest exists
- Added the Confused and the Chef origins
- Added Trailblazer's Helmet vanity
- Added Chinese translation
- Added better spawn system:
	Origins will now use their own world spawn instead of the world's default world spawn
	This makes no change in singleplayer and functions exactly the same
	In multiplayer, that means each origin will respect their own spawn location
		For example, if I have Slayer and my friend is a Purist, she will spawn normally, whereas I will spawn in an Ash Forest
	Changing spawn with beds and such works normally, this only applies to using the default spawn
